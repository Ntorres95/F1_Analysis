# Possible Questions:
Which organization has the most wins?
Are there any correlations between drivers and tracks? Between organizations and tracks?

# Inspiration
I recently started watching F1 and am really intrigued by the amount of team work that goes in to every race, both the day of and on the days before. Race day is not just about who the best driver is, but also about who has the most funding, the best built car, the best engineers, the best pit crew, and the best strategists. No to mention, things like the track they're on and the weather that day can influence overall race results.
